## Unreleased

### Added

- Project skeleton: Python package `tabrion_studio` (hatchling, ruff, mypy strict, import-linter) and the React 19 /
  TypeScript 5.9 / Vite 8 frontend in `frontend/` (eslint, prettier, strict `tsc`, vitest) with a placeholder page
  (STU-001).
- `tabrion-studio` command and process model: loopback-only server on a free port, one instance per project folder
  (a second start reuses it), idle exit after 30 minutes, `--stop`, clean shutdown on Ctrl+C and SIGTERM (STU-002).
- CI (`ci.yml`, `ci-ok.yml` with the commit status `ci-ok`, `nightly.yml`) on Linux, macOS and Windows; the wheel
  build hook that requires the built frontend; a wheel smoke test without Node (STU-018).
- License policy check with negative probes and CycloneDX SBOMs for the Python runtime and the frontend (STU-031).
- Access protection (STU-003, `docs/architecture/access-protection.md`): one-time launch token in the URL fragment
  (`/launch#<token>`, 120 s, once), exchanged by the page through `POST /api/session` for an `HttpOnly;
  SameSite=Strict` session cookie (`tabrion_studio_session_<port>`) and a CSRF value kept in `sessionStorage` and sent
  as `X-Tabrion-CSRF`; `tabrion-studio --print-url` prints a one-time sign-in link. Every request passes the access
  middleware: Host allowlist `127.0.0.1:<port>` on every route, no forwarded headers, Origin and fetch-metadata
  checks, JSON-only API requests, session plus CSRF header on every API route except health and the launch exchange.
  Every answer carries a strict Content-Security-Policy, `Cache-Control: no-store`, `nosniff`, `no-referrer`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and same-origin opener and resource policies (STU-T-001..006, -014, -025, -026).

- App shell, design system and languages (STU-005, `docs/architecture/frontend.md`): header, activity bar, status
  bar and the views Start, Connections, Settings and Not found; `--tb-` design tokens with a complete light and dark
  theme (system default, selectable) and compact or normal density; components copied from axentra-studio with a
  provenance note; German and English (i18next), with a completeness test. Contrast test of the tokens in both themes
  and axe without serious or critical violations (jsdom in CI; Chromium with colour contrast in `frontend/e2e/`).
- Status displays and dialogs (STU-051): environment badge (DEV, TEST, PROD) in the header, on every tab and in the
  window title (`[PROD] name – Tabrion Studio`) with a red frame for PROD; access mode, transaction and connection
  displays; the dialogs D-01, D-02, D-06 and D-08 with tested focus rules (initial focus on the safe option, focus
  trap, Escape cancels, focus returns to the opener).
- Brand assets (`assets/branding/`): the Tabrion Studio lockup, marks and favicons derived from Peter Karlhuber's logo
  master with the shared brand kit (no redraw, no CSS filters), the social preview, and `TRADEMARKS.md` (the names and
  logos are not MIT). The committed masters carry no C2PA or eXIf metadata; a test proves the pixels unchanged.
- The command prints a hint when the default browser on Linux is a snap or a Flatpak, which cannot open the sign-in
  file in a hidden state directory (TD-002, review S-4 of `stu-003-review.md`).

### Security

- Review of PR #4 (`stu-003-review.md`), S-1: when the server no longer knows the tab's session (a restart, or a
  program on another local port that replaced the session cookie), the page stops the heartbeat and says "Your session
  has ended. Run `tabrion-studio` again to open Studio." The cookie-tossing residual risk is documented.

- Review of PR #1 (`stu-002-018-review.md`): the control client makes the server prove the control token (HMAC over a
  client nonce) before it sends the token, and opens only launch URLs of that instance; stale info files are removed
  when the lock is taken and at the start of a shutdown (F-01). SIGHUP and Windows CTRL_CLOSE stop Studio cleanly
  (F-04). Only authenticated control requests and same-origin heartbeats (`GET /api/heartbeat`) reset the idle timer
  (F-06). Unsafe state directories are refused: group- or world-writable or foreign-owned on POSIX (F-10), outside
  the profile without a private ACL or behind a junction on Windows (F-07). `[::1]` on the same port is held (F-08).
  ci-ok reports NOT OK for unreviewed changes to `.github/workflows/**` or `.github/scripts/**` (label
  `workflow-change-reviewed`, F-03) and retries the status post, failing loudly (F-11).
- STU-003 binding requirements of the review (`stu-002-018-review.md`, condition C-3): the browser is opened with the
  `file://` path of a 0600 redirect file and never with the token URL, so no process argv shows the token; the file
  is deleted when the token is used or expires, at shutdown and at the next start (F-02). The Host allowlist covers
  every route, and the control endpoints refuse requests with `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-*` (F-05). `localhost` and
  `[::1]` are not answered (F-08). A session cookie alone opens nothing without its CSRF value (F-09). Requests with
  a valid session count as activity; the heartbeat needs the session (F-06, R-5).
- Re-review recommendations: the control client sends the proof request and the request with the token over one
  keep-alive connection and never reconnects in between (R-4). The workflow-change gate guards every file under
  `.github/` except the issue and pull request templates (R-3), accepts the label `workflow-change-reviewed` only if
  it was set after the latest push (R-2), and the `ci-ok` status description names its run; the merging party checks
  the ci-ok run link before every merge (R-1).

### Changed

- `/api/heartbeat` and `/api/openapi.json` need a session. The control endpoint `POST /api/control/launch` takes
  `{"redirect": true|false}` and answers the launch URL and the redirect file. The Vite development proxy presents the
  backend's own Host and Origin.
